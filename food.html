               <p>Anthony Hopkins <q> My weak spot is laziness. Oh, I have a lot of weak spots: cookies, croissants.<q> </p> 
           A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry named for its crescent shape.
           </header>
           <aside>
             <p>Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Combine yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Allow to stand until creamy and frothy.</li>
        <li>Measure flour into a mixing bowl. Dissolve 2 teaspoons sugar and salt in warm milk. Blend into flour along with yeast and oil. Mix well; knead until smooth. Cover, and let rise until over triple in volume, about 3 hours. Deflate gently, and let rise again until doubled, about another 3 hours. Deflate and chill 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily. Pat dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle. Smear butter over top two thirds, leaving 1/4-inch margin all around. Fold unbuttered third over middle third, and buttered top third down over that. Turn 90 degrees, so that folds are to left and right. Roll out to a 14x6-inch rectangle. Fold in three again. Sprinkle lightly with flour, and put dough in a plastic bag. Refrigerate 2 hours. Unwrap, sprinkle with flour, and deflate gently. Roll to a 14x6-inch rectangle, and fold again. Turn 90 degrees, and repeat. Wrap, and chill 2 hours.</li>
        <li>To shape, roll dough out to a 20x5-inch rectangle. Cut in half crosswise, and chill half while shaping the other half. Roll out to a 15 x 5 inch rectangle. Cut into three 5 x 5 inch squares. Cut each square in half diagonally. Roll each triangle lightly to elongate the point, and make it 7 inches long. Grab the other 2 points, and stretch them out slightly as you roll it up. Place on a baking sheet, curving slightly. Let shaped croissants rise until puffy and light. In a small bowl, beat together egg and 1 tablespoon water. Glaze croissants with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) oven for 12 to 15 minutes.</li>

               <p>Hugh Jackman <q> For Sunday breakfast, I make orange and ricotta pancakes, crepes and eggs. You know men, we usually go for breakfast because it's the easiest thing to cook and then we try to make it seem fancy.<q> </p> 
           A crêpe or crepe is a type of very thin pastry. Crêpes are usually of two types: sweet crêpes and savoury galettes.
           </header>
           <aside>
             <p>Master pastry chef Jacques Torres gave us his recipe for basic crêpes, which get a rich, nutty flavor from brown butter in the batter. The recipe works equally well for sweet or savory preparations; try filling them with ham, egg, and cheese or bananas and homemade Nutella.</p>

        <li>In a small skillet, heat the butter over medium-high until it smells nutty and turns golden in color, about 4 minutes. Pour the butter into a blender along with the water, flour, milk, egg yolks, salt, and sugar, and blend until smooth. Pour the batter into a bowl (you should have 4 cups).</li>
        <li>Heat a 12-inch non-stick crêpe pan or skillet over medium-high heat and using a crumpled paper towel, grease the pan lightly with oil. Using a ladle, pour ½ cup of the batter in the center of the pan, quickly swirling to pan to coat the entire surface with batter, and cook, without touching, for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using an offset spatula, carefully flip the crêpe and cook 1 minute more. Transfer the crêpe to a plate and repeat making crêpes with the remaining batter until you have 8 crêpes total.</li>
